## 👋 Hello, I'm Jordan! 

My passion for programming stems from my freshman year high school, where I "coded" with command blocks on my Nintendo Switch. Overtime, my passion grew, and I began to pursue bigger goals regarding my career. I learned how to code with real languages and even began making a profit from commissions. Now I'm here, a full time college student majoring in computer science. I strive to continuously learn and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

### 🌱 Current Interests
- **Programming Languages:** 4 years with JS and JSON, learning HTML, CSS, C++, C & Python.
- **Collaborative Work:** Looking to make friends and collaborate with others, whether it be coding or not.

### 🔭 My Projects: 
- **Asteroid PvP**: My Minecraft Bedrock server based around Script API, which has been refined and constantly updated for 4 years, growing to about 2500 total users and 10-30 conurrent players at a time.
- I also work on many other smaller projects 

### 💡 Fun Facts About Me
- I love cats so much despite never owning one for myself. They take up my entire camera roll and feed on several social media platforms I use. They're just so cute and adorable!
- When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy playing video games or volleyball.

### 🤝 Let's Connect!
